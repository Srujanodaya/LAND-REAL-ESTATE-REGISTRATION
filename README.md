# LAND-REAL-ESTATE-REGISTRATION
This project seeks to transform land registration through the implementation of an online system, promoting accessibility and eliminating corruption and intermediary dependencies. The technology stack encompasses HTML for user interfaces, SQL for robust database management, and Java for efficient application logic. Employing the MVC architecture for the separation of data model, user interface, and application control, the initiative enables users to register land without intermediary involvement. The system prioritizes data integrity, transparency, and security, integrating features such as user authentication, transaction history, and audit trails. Thorough testing and comprehensive documentation are pivotal elements, ensuring the dependability and user-friendliness of the platform. Designed with scalability in mind, the project anticipates future enhancements to meet evolving requirements, providing a trustworthy and accessible online land registration experience.
